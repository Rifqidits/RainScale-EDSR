# RainScale-EDSR
The demand for high-resolution precipitation forecasts is increasing, particularly to support climate and hydrological studies at the local scale. The proposed model adopts the Enhanced Deep Super Resolution (EDSR) architecture to perform spatial downscaling from a resolution of 0.25° to 0.1°.
